# Flow featurization

This software is for generating datasets that you can download using
`python3 -m botnet_attention.iscx.download` and 
`python3 -m botnet_attention.isot.download`.

Unless you intend on adding a new dataset or modifying the preprocessing procedures for the default ISCX and ISOT datasets, you should not need to use this module.
