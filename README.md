# Botnet detection in enterprise networks using recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms (prototype: 6/1/2017)
Scripts and a general pipeline for
* Pumping in and processing data from ISCX/ISOT
* Flow feature generation and attention-friendly preprocessing
* Custom Tensorflow model
* Variety of utilities

This codebase is outdated and the most recent public prototype as of 6/1/2017. This repository will be updated in October with a pipeline and model performing with improved accuracy on ISCX.
